## Backend Files

### `backend/src/index.ts` - Main Server Entry Point

#### Q: Why did you structure your main server file this way?
**A:** I structured it this way to create a clean, maintainable server setup. The file serves as the central hub that:
- Loads environment variables with dotenv
- Configures middleware in the correct order (security first, then parsing, then routes)
- Sets up error handling globally
- Provides health check endpoints for monitoring
- Initializes the demo user for testing

#### Q: Why did you use `helmet()` middleware?
**A:** Helmet is crucial for security as it sets various HTTP headers to protect against common vulnerabilities like:
- XSS attacks (X-Content-Type-Options)
- Clickjacking (X-Frame-Options)
- MIME type sniffing (X-Content-Type-Options)
- Information disclosure (X-Powered-By removal)

#### Q: Why did you configure CORS this way?
**A:** I configured CORS with specific origin and credentials because:
- **Specific Origin**: Only allows requests from the frontend URL, preventing unauthorized cross-origin requests
- **Credentials**: Enables cookies and authorization headers to be sent with requests
- **Security**: Prevents potential CSRF attacks from unknown domains

#### Q: Why did you use different JSON parsing for upload routes?
**A:** This is a common pattern because:
- **Multer Conflict**: JSON parsing can interfere with multipart/form-data parsing needed for file uploads
- **Performance**: Avoids unnecessary parsing for file uploads
- **Clean Separation**: Keeps file upload logic separate from JSON API logic

#### Q: Why multiple health check endpoints?
**A:** I included multiple health checks for different purposes:
- `/health` - Simple connectivity test (no database dependencies)
- `/api/health` - Comprehensive health check with uptime and environment info
- **Railway Deployment**: Platform-specific health checks for container orchestration

- **Security Monitoring**: Tracks failed login attempts and suspicious activity
- **Development**: Easier to debug JWT token issues during development

#### Q: Why did you implement `optionalAuth` middleware?
**A:** Optional authentication is useful for:
- **Public Endpoints**: Routes that work for both authenticated and anonymous users
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Features that improve with authentication but don't require it
- **API Flexibility**: Allows the same endpoint to serve different user types

#### Q: Why not use session-based authentication instead of JWT?
**A:** I chose JWT over sessions because:
- **Stateless**: No server-side session storage needed, better for scaling
- **Microservices**: Easy to verify tokens across different services
- **Mobile Apps**: Works well with mobile applications
- **Performance**: No database lookups for every request
- **Decentralized**: Token contains all necessary user information

#### Q: Why did you use a fallback secret key?
**A:** The fallback is for development convenience, but in production:
- **Environment Variables**: Always use proper JWT_SECRET from environment
- **Security**: Never use the same secret across different environments
- **Rotation**: Secrets should be rotated regularly in production

- **Performance**: Avoids fetching unnecessary data

#### Q: Why did you use Promise.all for statistics?
**A:** Promise.all is perfect here because:
- **Parallel Execution**: All three queries run simultaneously
- **Performance**: Faster than sequential await calls
- **Atomicity**: Either all succeed or all fail together
- **Clean Code**: Single line instead of multiple await statements
